Hello. This program reads a master input file, and reads the data files within the input file.
The program retrieves the names of the data files and from each one of them reads every line, extract name and distance.
The results are then outputted and exported to a separate .csv file.

Methodology:

1. Open master input file. Then open files within master input file.
2. Initialize data a container using a dictionary (person_distances) and a list (data).
3. Create nested loop to read each line of each file.
4. If a person's name appears more than once, appends run time to the end of the name.
5. Calculate the max and min times for all runners.
6. Calculate the total distance of all runners.
7. While running through the list of people, counter keeps track of duplicate runners.
8. Counter keeps record of the number of participants.
9. Print each runner and time to output file (output file must be opened first).
10. Print out results (all results are calculated or defined at this point.
