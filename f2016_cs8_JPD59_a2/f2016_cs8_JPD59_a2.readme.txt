Hello. This assignment dealt with reading files, calculating the number of lines and total distance ran, and outputting results in a clear way.

Here is the methodology behind my programs:

Two functions were defined and used in this program: processFile and printKV.

ProcessFile:
1. Creates a loop to read the file line by line.
2. Converts the string into an array.
3. Adds one for each line and adds the data together.
4. Removes the last line.
5. Returns with the total number of lines and total amount of data.

PrintKV:
1. Prints out the info that is returned from the function.
2. Formats the key at n-length characters.
3. Formats the string so that it is 30 spaces long.
4. Formats the integer so that it is 10 spaces long.
5. Formats the float so that it is 10 spaces and 3 decimal spaces long.

With both functions defined, the program can ask for input to correctly output the desired results.
1. Ask user for a file to input
2. Set total distance and total number = to 0
3. Creates a loop to open the function, return, and quit
4. Initialize the printKV function
