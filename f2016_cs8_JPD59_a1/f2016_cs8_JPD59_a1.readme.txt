Hello. This assignment dealt with converting units, calculating Gas consumption, and outputting results in a clear way.
Here is the methodology behind my programs:
1. Ask user to input unit system preference
2. Ask for distance driven and how much gas was used. Use if-elif statement to properly follow user's unit system choice
3. Define variables based on unit system used
4. Convert unit system from initial user choice to other unit system (USC or metric)
5. Four variables are defined at this point, so we can calculate the gas consumption
6. Gas consumption rating can now be defined by using if-elif statements
7. With all variables defined, we can now print out a results table
