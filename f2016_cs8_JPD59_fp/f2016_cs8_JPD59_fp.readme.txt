Hello. This program reads a master input file, and reads the data files within the input file.
The program retrieves the names of the data files and from each one of them reads every line, extract name and distance.
The results are then outputted and exported to a separate .csv file.

This program is similar to assignment 3. However, a class was used in this program.
The method of obtaining the results is quite different from assignment 3.

Methodology:

1. Create class 'participant' with appropriate properties and methods.
2. Create function 'getDataFromFile' to read all lines in the file and processes them and add them to an output list.
3. Ask user to inout the master file.
4. Calculate number of files, lines, and distance.
5. Calculate maximum and minimum by looping through distances and updating max/min each loop if necessary
6. Calculate total number of runners and number of appearances each one of them has.
7. Output concatenated list to separate cvs file.
8. Output calculation results to the user.
